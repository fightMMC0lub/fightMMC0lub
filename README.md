## 📝 About Me

Hello! I'm Fouad, a cybersecurity student from Fes, Morocco. I'm currently studying digital infrastructure with a focus on cybersecurity and learning how systems work and how to protect them.

I'm still early in my learning journey, but I'm excited about security and enjoy figuring out how things work. Right now, I'm focused on understanding the basics and building a solid foundation.

Outside of studies, I work on small projects to practice what I'm learning. I believe the best way to learn is by doing, so I try to apply new concepts through hands-on practice.
