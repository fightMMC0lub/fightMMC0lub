# Hi, I’m Fouad (fightMMC0lub)

I'm a student at IFMOTICA Fès, learning networks.  
I like building small Python tools, testing stuff, and exploring how things work

Right now, I'm just sharing some of the projects I’m building to help me learn 

Everything here is just for learning and personal growth.
